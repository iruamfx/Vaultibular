##### Measure **≠** Length. 

The measure of an arc can be given by the formula: 
#### $$Arc = θ \cdot r$$Where:
θ = Angle in radians
r = Radius of circle

Lets break this down:
A [[Radian]] is a unit of measure for an arc, that corresponds to the radius of a circle. So: $$1rad = 1r$$
This means that if you want to get an arc that measures $2$ times $r$, this arc will measure $$2rad$$and so on...

Now, suppose you want to get the measure of an arc, in radians, whose corresponding angle is 180°, on any circle. For this, we can use the fundamental $\pi$ relation: $$\frac{Semicircle}{r} = \pi \to Semicircle = \pi \cdot r$$
Which means that a semi-circle, or, an 180° degree arc, will always have length $rads \cdot r \to \pi \cdot r$ 
This can further be extended for any angle we desire, since now that we know a 180° degree angle is equal to $\pi rad$, the equivalent in radians for any other angle can be calculated by the relation: $$\frac{\pi}{x} = \frac{180}{θ}$$ 
#### Where:
θ = Angle in degrees
x = Angle in radians

And finally, for the length of this arc, since a radian unit is the length of an arc times a circle's radius, all we need to do is multiply the obtained angle by the radius $r$ of the circle to reach its length.
