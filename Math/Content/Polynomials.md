# What is it?
A polynomial is an algebraic expression formed by numbers (coefficients) and letters (literals). It's name (monomial, binomial, trinomial, etc..) is given based on the number of monomials present in the expression. Monomials follow the form: $$ R \cdot x \cdot x_2 \cdot x_n \cdot y_n$$
Where $R$ is a real number, acting as the coefficient of the monomial, and $x_n$ acts as the literal part.
