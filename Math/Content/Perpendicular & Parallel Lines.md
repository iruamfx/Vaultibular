##### **Perpendicular** Lines **≠** **Parallel** lines. 

That is: while [[Linear]] form  **Parallel** lines are characterized by possessing the same slope coefficient and never intersecting, **Perpendicular** lines are characterized by a 90° degree angle in their intersection and the product of their slope coefficients will always equal -1.
E.g. For the equation -2x + 2, its perpendicular line's slope can be found by multiplicating its slope -2 by the second's line slope A and equating to -1: 

$-2\cdot A = -1 -> A = \frac{-1}{-2} -> A = \frac{1}{2}$
